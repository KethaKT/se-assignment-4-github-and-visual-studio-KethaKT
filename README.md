2.	Watch Windows:
o	Purpose: Watch windows allow developers to monitor the values of variables, expressions, and properties in real-time during debugging sessions.
o	Usage: Add variables or expressions to watch by typing them into the watch window or hovering over them in the code editor.
3.	Autos and Locals Windows:
o	Purpose: Autos and locals windows automatically display variables relevant to the current context (local variables in the current scope or variables used recently).
o	Usage: Use these windows to quickly inspect the values of variables without explicitly adding them to watch windows.
4.	Call Stack:
o	Purpose: The call stack window shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution.
o	Usage: Navigate through the call stack to understand the execution path of your program and identify where issues may originate.
5.	Immediate Window:
o	Purpose: The immediate window allows developers to execute arbitrary code and evaluate expressions interactively during debugging.
o	Usage: Use it to test expressions, modify variable values on-the-fly, or perform calculations to assist in debugging complex logic.
6.	Debugging Controls:
o	Purpose: Visual Studio provides controls to manage the debugging session, such as stepping through code, pausing execution, continuing execution, restarting, and stopping debugging.
o	Usage: Use F10 (Step Over) to execute the current line of code without entering function calls, and F11 (Step Into) to enter function calls and navigate through code line-by-line.
7.	Debugging Tools for Different Languages:
o	Purpose: Visual Studio offers specialized debugging tools tailored to different programming languages, including C#, C++, JavaScript, Python, and more.
o	Usage: These tools provide language-specific insights and capabilities, ensuring comprehensive support for debugging across various development environments. (ChatGPT)
Using Debugging Tools to Identify and Fix Issues
1.	Setting Breakpoints: Place breakpoints strategically in areas of suspected issues. When execution pauses at a breakpoint, use watch windows to examine variable values and the call stack to understand the program flow.
2.	Inspecting Variable Values: Use watch windows, autos, and locals to monitor variable values and track how they change during execution. Compare expected and actual values to pinpoint discrepancies.
3.	Navigating the Call Stack: Trace the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls leading to an issue. Identify where unexpected behavior or errors occur within nested function calls.
4.	Interactive Evaluation: Use the immediate window to execute code snippets or modify variable values interactively. Test hypotheses, validate calculations, or manipulate state to isolate and reproduce issues.
5.	Debugging Controls: Employ stepping controls (F10 for step over, F11 for step into) to navigate through code systematically. Use debugging controls to manage the pace of execution and focus on specific code segments.
6.	Error Messages and Exceptions: Visual Studio highlights error messages, exceptions, and warnings during debugging. Use these cues to prioritize issues and focus debugging efforts on critical areas. (ChatGPT)
